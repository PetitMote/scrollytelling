# Scrollytelling example

This project is a little example of a scrollytelling web page. It aims at showing what I can do, and to let me practice and build my toolbox / template.

You can access the demo here (french only, sorry) :

## Libraries

Iâ€™m using three awesome open source libraries :

- [Scroll scene element](https://github.com/rdmurphy/scroll-scene-element) by @rdmurphy : scroll events, really the basis for this webpage
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) : charts (as you could guess), easy and intuitive library
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) : maps. Well, not in the example for now, but it will.

## Data sources
